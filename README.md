Additional Features:
--------------------

1. Geotagging a note.
2. Adding photos to a note (either from your library or taking a new one.)
3. Core Data Implementation (UIManagedDocument and Persistent Store Coordinator)
4. Pure webservice implementation (possibly syncing into core data instead of syncing "directly" into the table)
5. Editing existing notes
6. Adding tags to notes (then search?)
7. Search notes from table view

Bugs:

Issues:
-------

1. Deleting a note that is selected in the detail view of the split view controller for iPad does not clear out the detail view. Not sure of a solid MVC approach for doing this.
